```
$ npm install
```

## Getting Start 

Please first run mongodb on it's default port, 27017 (Don't forget to set the permission to the mongodb data directory if this is your first time installing mongodb on this machine, see the installation in [mongodb documentation page](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/))

```
$ mongod
```

and then open another terminal window(or just keep the mongodb running in the background) and run the simple express server index.js:
```
$ node index.js
```

The app is now running on localhost:8080
